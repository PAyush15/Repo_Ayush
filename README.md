# Story
### In this very COVID-19 affected world now it has become difficult to move around places either for work or to shop some groceries or even for a small get-together for family and friends. The very sole reason for this problem is no vaccine is found yet. But still to carry on day to day task at meeting we can we can sanitize it with some device like UV- light we have an ability to kill extremely dangers viruses. In this very COVID-19 affected world now it has become difficult to move around places either for work or to shop some groceries or even for a small get-together for family and friends. The very sole reason for this problem is no vaccine is found yet. But still to carry on day to day task at meeting we can we can sanitize it with some device like UV- light we have an ability to kill extremely dangers viruses.

### This UV Rover has an extreme ability to go into corners of small office rooms to disinfect the place using its UV rays spreading into each corner, walls, and under the table. The utmost priority is given to protecting the people from this kind of viruses.

### This has a simple working mechanism placed on a rover with six wheels for mobility. A lead screw mechanism for vertical motion of UV light, LiDAR sensor and ultrasonic sensor for mapping and obstacle detection respectively, along with a battery pack for power supply. All these are centrally controlled by NVIDIA Jetson Nano controller which brings the best out of each sensor.

# The Plan
### As of now, more than 22.9M cases have been reported globally, resulting in more than 7, 99, 000 deaths and stillâ€¦So need to replace the human being in annihilating the virus by our robot/s as much as possible. The robot has the capability to detect the most touching thing in the environment like a door handle, chair, table, bed, etc and disinfect it very precisely and also reach to each and every area of the room (smallest to largest). The robot can safeguard any living thing in the surrounding area at any time by immediate switching off the system
